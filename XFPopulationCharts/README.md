# Population Charts Application  
This repository contains source code for Xamarin.Forms application that visualizes U.S. population over time by animating changes of population grouped by age in pyramid chart as well as population grouped by generation in radial chart. 

These visualizations are built using the [XamDataChart](https://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin/charts/data-chart) control which you can try for free by downloading the [Infragistics Ultimate UI for Xamarin](https://www.infragistics.com/products/xamarin) product.
